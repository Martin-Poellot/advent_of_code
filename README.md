My awful code for AoC!

Name says it all. All you need is python and numpy (for now).

Also don't forget: everyone has different input, so the code matters, not the final answer ;)

## Update:

I am adding runtimes since more complex puzzles arose that are sometimes not beatable with my simple approaches.

| Puzzle | Runtime Part 1 | Runtime Part 2 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.001 s | 0.001 s|
(more to come)
