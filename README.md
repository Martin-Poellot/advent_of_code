My awful code for AoC!

Name says it all. All you need is python and numpy (for now).

Also don't forget: everyone has different input, so the code matters, not the final answer ;)

## Update:

I am adding runtimes since more complex puzzles arose that are sometimes not beatable with my simple approaches.
